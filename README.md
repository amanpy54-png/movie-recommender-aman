# movie-recommender-aman
A Movie Recommender System built with Python and Streamlit. Users can select a movie they like, and the app suggests 5 similar movies based on content similarity using TF-IDF vectorization of movie metadata (genres, cast, crew, keywords, and overview). Movie posters are fetched dynamically from TMDB API.
